Inception (2010), directed by Christopher Nolan, is a mind-bending science fiction heist thriller. The film follows Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), a skilled thief who specializes in infiltrating the subconscious minds of others to extract secrets. He is offered a chance to have his criminal record erased if he can successfully perform "inception," the act of planting an idea in someone's mind without them realizing it.

Cobb assembles a team to enter the dreams of Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy), the heir to a business empire, to plant an idea that will lead Fischer to break up his father's company. The team navigates multiple layers of dreams within dreams, each with its own challenges and increasingly unstable environments. As they go deeper into Fischer's subconscious, the boundaries between reality and dreams blur, particularly for Cobb, who is haunted by memories of his deceased wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard).

The film explores themes of perception, memory, guilt, and the nature of reality. With its intricate plot, stunning visuals, and thought-provoking ideas, Inception leaves audiences questioning what is real and what is a dream, especially with its ambiguous ending.
